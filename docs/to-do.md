# To-do list

This is just a to-do list to track pending things.

- [ ] Review/Update Home Page

- [ ] Internal references to links (search chapter)
- [ ] Image captions (Should they include the **Figure** title?) (tooltip)
- [ ] Footnotes (as a Notes section per page) (Check if this can be excluded from sidebar)
- [ ] External links / References (home page with complete list of references, and add invisible list of references for maintenance)
- [ ] FIXM Schema links (Step1: add links for xsd files e.g. https://fixm.aero/releases/FFICE-Msg-1.0.0/schemas/applications/fficemessage/fficetemplates/filingstatus/flight/flightroutetrajectory/FficeFS_FlightRouteTrajectory.xsd)
- [x] Page width
- [x] Complete initial load

- [ ] Usage of [...] in code blocks is not compatible with sintax highlighting FIX: use comments or quotes for those
- [ ] We can improve codeblocks by formatting the code to avoid horrizontal scrollbars FIX: break some lines
- [ ] FAA to provide image for extensions section with NAS extension (Ask TJ)

## Proposals

- [ ] Remove Target audience as a page for some sections. Maybe substitude by "Introcudtion" or "About this section", where we can provide a *landing page* for the section, with a table of contents, etc. FIX: Add to home page
- [ ] Revisit usage of bold and italics
- [ ] Text refering to examples is sometimes above and sometimes bellow. This could be harmonised (not urgent)
- [ ] We should document markdown practices for the FIXM user manual. For example: Use `inline code` when refering to a FIXM package, class, property, pattern or value.

## Notes from TIM Meeting

- [x] Use **FIXM Application** instead of FIXM Application Library
- [ ] "Potential shortcomings of XSD..." new title (see proposal in slides)
- [ ] Add note on namespaces (see slides)
- [ ] Prepare diagram for users to choose if extension
