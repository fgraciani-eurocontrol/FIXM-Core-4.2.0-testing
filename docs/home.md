## Content and Target audience

- The part `GENERAL GUIDANCE` provides explanations about the main FIXM components and describes the general rules (encoding rules, data plausibility rules, rules for absent dataâ€¦) that are always applicable whatever the implementation context.
- The part `USING FIXM IN SUPPORT OF FF-ICE` provides specific guidance in support of the implementation of FF-ICE using FIXM.
- The part `USING FIXM FOR OTHER USE CASES` provides explanations and guidance for implementing FIXM in support of use cases not handled the FIXM CCB.
- The "How to" parts `HOW TO CREATE A FIXM APPLICATION`, `HOW TO CREATE A FIXM EXTENSION` and `HOW TO GENERATE XML SCHEMAS ...` provide step-by-step guidance for producing new FIXM Applications and FIXM extensions (UML and XSD).
- The part `FIXM DEVELOPMENT TOOL COMPATIBILITY` provides a Platform Support Matrix listing the tools and technologies for which compability tests have been performed for FIXM.
